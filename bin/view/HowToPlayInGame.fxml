Then a player can choose one of our four options of the categories and then 5 or 10 questions from that category. Players will get 10 seconds to answer 5 questions or 20 seconds to answer 10 questions. Once a question is asked, the player has to select one of the four answer choices and the app will keep track of which you got right and which you got wrong. If you complete the questions in time. You will be directed to the Results View that shows your score and which you got incorrect. Then from there, a player can choose to play again or return home. If you run out of time before answering all the questions, you will be directed to the Results view still and allow for easy access to play again, along with showing which questions you got wrong, but it will not give you a score.
